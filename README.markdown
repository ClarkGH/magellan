# Magellan Meteor Blog Platform

This blog is built for dynamic posting, user admins and an SEO-friendly back end to create the best possible Meteor blog for personal use.
It's built with [Meteor](http://meteor.com) and inspired by the tutorials of [The Meteor Book](http://themeteorbook.com).

This project uses the following packages:

- standard-app-packages
- underscore
- iron:router@1.0.0-rc.1
- sacha:spin
- accounts-password
- ian:accounts-ui-bootstrap-3
- audit-argument-checks
- mizzao:bootstrap-3
- useraccounts:bootstrap
- accounts-facebook
- accounts-twitter
- meteorhacks:kadira
- meteorhacks:zones
- email
- rgoomar:bootstrap-validator


## Purpose

This project is minimal in style, and ultimately geared to anyone who would like to have a personal blog of their own. This project can be freely forked and customized, as long as credit is given to its creator (in this case, 'aledotgomez').

### Testing
For testing and debugging purposes, this meteor utilizes Kadira and Meteorhack's Zones for detailed debug analysis and method response times.


## To do List (help is appreciated and encouraged)

- Integration with email for contact
- Installation of CollectionFS for image and file upload into document
- Google analytics
- Social Media configuration
